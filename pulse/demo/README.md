# Pulse Demo Data

Realistic demo data for a three-branch QSR (quick-service restaurant) chain.
Run it on any fresh Pulse installation to get a fully populated site with
users, org hierarchy, SOPs, historical runs, scores, and corrective actions.

---

## How to load

```bash
# Preferred — bench CLI command
bench --site <site> pulse-load-demo

# Alternative — bench execute
bench --site <site> execute pulse.demo.seed.seed_demo_data
```

## How to clear

```bash
bench --site <site> pulse-clear-demo

# or
bench --site <site> execute pulse.demo.seed.clear_demo_data
```

> Both operations are **idempotent**: loading skips records that already exist;
> clearing only removes what the seeder created.
